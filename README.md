# Stochasticity of epimutations

This repository contains the code used to generate the results in the paper "Stochasticity of epimutations in cancer" Frank Johannes and Constantin Goeldel. You can run the self-contained Jupiter Notebook either locally or through a service like Google Colab. Please let me know if you have any questions or comments. My email is constantin.goeldel@tum.de. Enjoy!
