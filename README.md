This repository contains the code used to generate the results in the paper "Stochasticity of epimutations in cancer" Frank Johannes and Constantin Goeldel. You can run the self-contained Jupiter Notebook either locally or through a service like Google Colab. Please let me know if you have any questions or comments. My email is constantin.goeldel@tum.de.
